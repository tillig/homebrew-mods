# Homebrew Mods

This is the example repo for [my blog article](https://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2023/09/28/hosting-customized-homebrew-formulae/) about customizing Homebrew formulae.

It's not for general consumption. There's no support. I may or may not keep these updated. I won't accept PRs or issues or anything. If you want to change something, fork.

Note that some formulae also allow for things like `brew install swig --HEAD` where it'll just go straight and clone the code to build.
