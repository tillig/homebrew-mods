# Homebrew Mods

Modified/customized versions of existing Homebrew formulae for my own use. For example, these may choose a different mirror from which to install a formula or skip steps I don't want for whatever reason.

It's not for general consumption. There's no support. I may or may not keep these updated. I won't accept PRs or issues or anything. If you want to change something, fork.
